# PWN Demo
This repository contains files and firmware that is used for the demo setup of PWN in Haarlem.

Basically it is a simulation of the process of purifying water into drinkingwater.

## Process flow
The following diagram shows the steps ![](/images/Process-schema.png)

It all starts with the collection of rainwater and storing it in a tank.

From this tank the water passes one or more filters. After purification the water is stored in a holding tank.

Finally there are consumers using the water from the holding tank. Their waste water will be returned to the first tank and be blended with the rain water.
